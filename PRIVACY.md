# Privacy Policy for PFC - Portfolio Forecast

**Last Updated: December 2, 2025**

## 1. Data Collection
PFC - Portfolio Forecast ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This extension does **not** collect, store, or sell any personally identifiable information (PII).

## 2. How We Use Your Data
The extension operates as follows:
*   **Stock Tickers**: When you click the extension icon, it scans the current webpage to identify stock ticker symbols (e.g., "AAPL", "TSLA").
*   **Forecasting**: These ticker symbols are sent to our backend server solely to generate a financial forecast.
*   **No User Tracking**: We do not track your browsing history, IP address, or link the data to your identity. The data sent to the server is anonymous.

## 3. Local Storage
We use your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) for the following purposes:
*   **Caching**: To store the most recent forecast temporarily so you don't have to re-fetch data unnecessarily.
*   **Preferences**: To remember the last stock page you visited to provide a smoother experience.
*   **Data Persistence**: This data stays on your device and is not sent to us.

## 4. Third-Party Services
We use reputable financial data providers (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) to retrieve stock market data. We do not share your personal information with these providers.

## 5. Contact
If you have any questions about this policy, please contact the developer via the Chrome Web Store support page.
