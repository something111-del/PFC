# PFC - Portfolio Forecast Chrome Extension

A real-time portfolio forecasting system that analyzes stock holdings and predicts 24-hour price movements using GARCH volatility modeling and Monte Carlo simulation. Built as a Chrome extension with a microservices architecture deployed on Google Cloud.

## 🎯 Core Capabilities

- **Automated Detection**: Scans portfolio holdings on major brokerage sites (Robinhood, Webull, TD Ameritrade, E*TRADE, Fidelity, Charles Schwab)
- **Advanced Forecasting**: Generates 24-hour price predictions using GARCH(1,1) volatility estimation and 10,000-path Monte Carlo simulations
- **Risk Analysis**: Color-coded risk indicators (Green/Yellow/Red) based on volatility and downside exposure
- **Real-time Data**: Pulls current prices and 60-day historical data from Alpha Vantage API
- **Smart Caching**: Sub-200ms response times for cached forecasts with Firestore persistence

## 🏗️ System Architecture

![PFC Architecture](docs/architecture_diagram.png)

### Three-Tier Design

The system follows a microservices architecture with clear separation of concerns:

**1. Chrome Extension (Client Layer)**
- Content scripts inject into brokerage websites to extract ticker symbols and portfolio holdings via DOM traversal
- Popup UI displays interactive forecast charts using Chart.js
- Uses Chrome Storage API (backed by IndexedDB with LSM-Tree structure) for caching

**2. Go API Service (Orchestration Layer)**
- High-performance Fiber web server handling concurrent requests
- Orchestrates data fetching from Alpha Vantage API using goroutines
- Manages Firestore cache with B+ Tree indexing for O(log n) lookups
- Aggregates portfolio-level metrics from individual ticker forecasts
- **Data Structures**: Go maps (HashMaps), slices (dynamic arrays), channels (FIFO queues)

**3. Python Model Service (Computation Layer)**
- FastAPI server running GARCH and Monte Carlo models
- Uses NumPy's contiguous C arrays for vectorized numerical operations
- Applies Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for GARCH parameter fitting
- **Data Structures**: NumPy ndarrays (C arrays), Pydantic models, Python dicts (HashMaps)

## 🧮 How Forecasting Works

### Example: Forecasting AAPL

**Starting State:**
- Current price: **$175.50** (from Alpha Vantage)
- Historical prices: 60 days of closing data
- Forecast horizon: 24 hours

### Step 1: GARCH Volatility Estimation

The system calculates log returns from historical prices:
```
returns = ln(price[t] / price[t-1])
Example: ln(174.50 / 173.20) = 0.0075 (0.75% return)
```

**GARCH(1,1) Model** estimates volatility using the formula:
```
σ²(t) = ω + α·ε²(t-1) + β·σ²(t-1)
```

Where:
- **ω** = Long-term average variance
- **α** = Weight on recent market shocks (surprise moves)
- **β** = Weight on past volatility (persistence)

The model uses **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (BFGS algorithm)** to find optimal parameters. For AAPL, this might yield:
- Daily volatility: 1.2%
- **Annualized volatility: 28%** (scaled by √252 trading days)

**Why GARCH?** Unlike simple standard deviation, GARCH adapts to market conditions. If last week was volatile, it predicts higher volatility today. If markets were calm, it adjusts downward.

### Step 2: Monte Carlo Simulation

Using the GARCH-estimated volatility, the system runs **10,000 parallel simulations** of possible price paths:

**Geometric Brownian Motion Formula:**
```
S(t) = S(0) × exp[(μ - 0.5σ²)·dt + σ·√dt·Z]
```

Where:
- **S(0)** = Current price ($175.50)
- **μ** = Drift (expected return)
- **σ** = Volatility from GARCH (28%)
- **Z** = Random shock from normal distribution

Each simulation generates a random market scenario:
```
Simulation #1: Z = +1.23 (lucky) → Final price: $182.87
Simulation #2: Z = -0.45 (unlucky) → Final price: $172.75
Simulation #8,543: Z = +0.12 → Final price: $176.42
... (10,000 total paths)
```

**Algorithm:** Mersenne Twister MT19937 for random number generation, Box-Muller transform for normal distribution.

### Step 3: Percentile Calculation

From 10,000 final prices, the system calculates risk percentiles using **Quickselect algorithm** (O(n) average):

```
p5  = $172.30  (5th percentile - 95% chance price stays above)
p50 = $176.80  (Median - most likely outcome)
p95 = $181.20  (95th percentile - 95% chance price stays below)
```

### Step 4: Risk Classification

```python
expected_return = (p50 - current_price) / current_price = 0.74%
downside_risk = (current_price - p5) / current_price = 1.82%
volatility = 28%

Risk Logic:
- Green: Low volatility (<5%) AND positive return (>2%)
- Red: High volatility (>10%) OR negative return (<-2%)
- Yellow: Moderate risk

Result for AAPL: RED (28% volatility exceeds threshold)
```

## 🎓 Technical Highlights

### Why This Architecture?

**Go for Orchestration:**
- Goroutines enable concurrent API calls (fetching AAPL and TSLA in parallel)
- Low memory footprint (512MB Cloud Run instance handles 100+ req/min)
- Fiber framework provides <1ms routing latency

**Python for Modeling:**
- NumPy's C-based arrays are 100x faster than pure Python for numerical ops
- GARCH library (Arch) provides battle-tested MLE implementations
- Vectorized operations leverage CPU SIMD instructions

**Firestore for Caching:**
- B+ Tree indexing provides O(log n) lookups vs O(n) for scanning
- TTL-based expiration (1-hour cache) balances freshness and API cost
- Global distribution reduces latency for worldwide users

### Key Design Decisions

1. **10,000 Monte Carlo Paths**: Statistical stability (percentiles within ±$0.10) without excessive computation
2. **60-Day Historical Window**: Sufficient data for GARCH convergence while staying responsive to recent market shifts
3. **24-Hour Forecast**: Short horizon reduces uncertainty and improves accuracy
4. **Cache Key Hashing (MD5)**: Deterministic cache hits regardless of ticker order (sorted before hashing)
